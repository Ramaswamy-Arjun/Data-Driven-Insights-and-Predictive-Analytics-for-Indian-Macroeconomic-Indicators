This project focuses on analysing and forecasting trends in Indian macroeconomic data, with a primary emphasis on Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections. By integrating data from various government sources, it provides comprehensive insights through advanced data visualization techniques and detailed exploratory data analysis. Leveraging machine learning methods, specifically Random Forest Regressor, the project predicts GST collections with a focus on accuracy and reliability. The analysis captures monthly trends in tax collections over multiple years, culminating in actionable insights for future predictions. This work bridges data science and economic analysis, offering valuable, data-driven insights for policymakers and financial analysts to support informed decisions about India's economic future.
